# Bootcamp Environment Setup Summary

- I successfully completed the complete development environment setup required for the bootcamp. This process helped me become comfortable with the Linux(UBUNTU) terminal, development tools, and essential workflows used in real-world software development.

- Then installed and configured a Linux virtual machine to ensure a stable and developer-friendly environment. Using terminal commands, I created the required folder structure.

- I installed Visual Studio Code before and it is helpful to me for verifying its functionality by launching it directly from the terminal using the `code .` command. 

- I already have Google Chrome now i installed the required developer extensions to support debugging and productivity during development.

- To organize my learning and planning, I installed XMind and created a mind map titled **“My Bootcamp Journey”**, outlining my goals, learning path.

- For backend and JavaScript development, I installed Node.js using **nvm (Node Version Manager)** and verified the installation by checking the Node version. 

- installed **pnpm** as a package manager and confirmed it was working correctly using the `pnpm --version` command.

- I installed **jq** to work with JSON data and successfully used it to pretty-print a sample JSON file, improving readability and understanding of structured data.

- Finally, I installed **Pandoc** and used it to convert a Markdown file into HTML (and/or PDF), which helped me understand documentation workflows and content formatting used in professional projects.
