## “Why I joined this bootcamp and what I want from it.”
- Actually, as a recent graduate i want to bridge the gap between my academic knowledge and the practical skills that employers are looking for. I realized that while my degree gave me a strong foundation, I need hands-on experience with industry-standard tools and real-world projects to be job-ready and What I want from this bootcamp is to gain practical, marketable skills that will help me launch my career. I'm looking to build a strong portfolio, learn from experienced mentors, and connect with peers who share similar goals. Most importantly, I want to develop the confidence and expertise needed to contribute effectively from day one in my first role.

- For me, a good day of learning starts with clear goals—knowing what I need to accomplish by the end of the day, whether it's mastering a new concept, completing a coding challenge, or building a feature.
